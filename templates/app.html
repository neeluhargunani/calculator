                      <p class="mt-3">Although being lean can often be healthy, being underweight can be a concern if it's the result of poor nutrition or if you are pregnant or have other health concerns. So, if you're underweight, see your doctor or dietitian for an evaluation. Together, you can plan how to meet your goal weight.</p>

                      <h5 class="mt-3 py-3"><b>Here are some healthy ways to gain weight when you're underweight:</b></h5>
    <h6><li>1. Eat more frequently. When you're underweight, you may feel full faster.</li></h6>
    <h6> <li>2.Eat five to six smaller meals during the day rather than two or three large meals.</li></h6>
    <h6>  <li>Choose nutrient-rich foods

                        <h6 class="mt-2"> <li>Watch when you drink. Some people find that drinking fluids before meals blunts their appetite. In that case, it may be better to sip higher calorie beverages along with a meal or snack.For others, drinking 30 minutes after a meal, not with it, may work.</li></h6>
                      <h6 class="mt-2"> <li>Make every bite count. Snack on nuts, peanut butter, cheese, dried fruits and avocados. </li><li>Have a bedtime snack, such as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or a wrap sandwich with avocado, sliced vegetables, and lean meat or cheese.</li></h6>
                      <h6 class="mt-2"><li>Top it off. Add extras to your dishes for more calories â€” such as cheese in casseroles and scrambled eggs, and fat-free dried milk in soups and stews.</li></h6>
                      <h6 class="mt-2"> <li>Have an occasional treat. Even when you're underweight, be mindful of excess sugar and fat.</li> <li>An occasional slice of pie with ice cream is OK. But most treats should be healthy and provide nutrients in addition to calories. Bran muffins, yogurt and granola bars are good choices.</li></h6>

                  <h3 class="text-primary mt-2">2. Donâ€™t skip breakfast and eat on time</h3>
                      <p>If you forgo your breakfast you extend this fast which might impact your metabolism. You should have breakfast within two hours of waking up. Those who skip breakfast tend to eat more portions of food in the next meal. Consuming a healthy breakfast restores the glucose levels in the body and lowers stress levels</p>
                  <h3 class="text-primary mt-2">3. Exercise regularly</h3>

                      <p>If you think you need to be drinking more, here are some tips to increase your fluid intake and reap the benefits of water: Have a beverage with every snack and meal. Choose beverages you enjoy; you're likely to drink more liquids if you like the way they taste. Eat more fruits and vegetables</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid mt-2" src="https://www.sturdrinks.eu/images/new/5-glasses-of-water.jpg" alt="Drinking water helps reduce BMI" width="100%" height="280" data-pin-no-hover="true"><p></p>

                      <p>If you donâ€™t want a beer belly, you need to cut down your alcohol consumption. Alcohol of any kind, not just beer, contains lots of calories. So, while trying to attain an ideal BMI, alcohol is not your best friend. In fact, a glass of wine contains as many calories as a chocolate piece.</p>
                 <p>While you try to reduce the number that the BMI calculator shows you, donâ€™t forget that seeking help and advice from doctors, physicians and/or dietitians is very important. They will be able to give you a better understanding of your condition and help you get where you want to be.</p>
